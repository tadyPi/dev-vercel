# Dev Vercel

## Overview
This project is a recreation of the Velora wordpress theme.This is a Next.js application that leverages [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design, [Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/) for generating React code, and [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. 
It also uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

## Figma Design
We use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create and collaborate on design prototypes. Figma allows us to visually design the user interface and user experience, ensuring that our design aligns with our development goals.

## Builder.io for React Code Creation
[Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/) is utilized to generate React code from design components. This integration allows us to streamline the process of converting design elements into functional React components, reducing manual coding and minimizing errors.

## Next.js Application
The generated React components from Builder.io are integrated into our [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application. Next.js provides a robust framework for building React applications with server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.

## Development Workflow with VS Code
Our development workflow is centered around [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Here is a typical workflow:

1. **Design in Figma**: Start by creating or updating designs in Figma.
2. **Generate Code with Builder.io**: Use Builder.io to convert Figma designs into React components.
3. **Develop in VS Code**: Open the project in VS Code, integrate the generated components, and continue developing the application.
4. **Style with Tailwind CSS**: Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
5. **Run and Test**: Use Next.js development server to run and test the application locally.
6. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting and continuous deployment.
